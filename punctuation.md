# Punctuation

The writing section tests the follow punctuation concepts: comma usage `,`,
colon usage `:`, semi-colon usage `;`, contractions `'`, possession `'`, and dash usage `–`.

### Comma Usage

There are four places where one uses a comma:

1. Separating items in a list.

  *Teachers commonly work many more hours than the official time they spend in
 school, typically preparing for class, grading exams, and performing other tasks
 outside the formally defined school day.*

2. Before a conjunction (F.A.N.B.O.Y: for, and, nor, but, or, yet) joining two sentences.

 *I am tired, but I will keep studying for the SAT.*

3. Separating an 'introductory thought'.

  *In fact, one of the rules enacted by the English court system in the
 17th century is still relevant in the United States in the 21st century.*

4. Separating out a 'descriptive phrase'.  A pair of commas surrounds a phrase
giving more information about something.  

 *Delta group, who made the biggest improvement on the first practice test, will
never become complacent.*


### Colon Usage

There are two places where one uses a colon:

1. Starting off a list.

 *New York City has five boroughs: Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, the Bronx, and
Staten Island.*

2. Joining a phrase with details about the phrase, in a way that emphasizes the
details.

 *I was enchanted by the tiniest thing of all: the dachshund puppy.* 

### Semi-colon Usage

A semi-colon joins two related complete sentences.  Two complete sentences can also be joined
by a conjunction (F.A.N.B.O.Y) and a comma, or separated by a period.  

 *Patrick likes to eat candy, Daouda likes to eat cookies.*
 
Join sentence fragments with a semi-colon, comma, or a comma and a conjunction. 

*My therapist tells me that fear is a normal. Legitimate response to genuine danger.*  **fragment**

*My therapist tells me that fear is a normal, legitimate response to genuine danger.*  **complete sentence**

### Contractions

A contraction is when two words are joined with an apostrophe `'`.

Examples:

- can not -> can't
- will not -> won't
- it is -> it's

To determine if a contraction is used correctly, expand it, and see if it still makes sense.

*It's time for class.* **correct**

*The company staked it's robotics division’s future on using artificial intelligence.* **incorrect**

*The company staked its robotics division’s future on using artificial intelligence.* **correct**

### Possession

An apostrophe is added to a word when it possesses another word, except in the case of `it`.  
(Remember, `it's` expands to `it is`.)  The only other exception is certain common phrases like
"shoe lace", "car door", etc: we don't say "shoe's lace", "car's door", etc.
Examples:

- Patrick's dog
- the bus' bumper
- the cat's meow

Don't use an apostrophe when there isn't posession.

*Many governments are oppressive.*

### Dash Usage

Dashes are used in the following situations:

1. Separating a descriptive phrase.
2. Introducing a change in tone.
3. Presenting an explanation.  
4. 
5. If you see a dash, it should be paired with another dash, or the sentence should should end.

*John was very excited to win the two concert tickets – it was the first time he had ever won a radio contest – and
he knew exactly who he would bring.*
