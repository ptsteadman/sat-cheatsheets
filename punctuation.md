# Punctuation

The writing section tests the follow punctuation concepts: comma usage `,`,
colon usage `:`, semi-colon usage `;`, contractions `'`, possession `'`, and dash usage `-`.

### Comma Usage

There are four places where one uses a comma:

1. Separating items in a list.
  *Teachers commonly work many more hours than the official time they spend in
school, typically preparing for class, grading exams, and performing other tasks
outside the formally defined school day.*
2. Before a conjunction (F.A.N.B.O.Y: for, and, nor, but, or, yet) joining two sentences.
*I am tired, but I will keep studying for the SAT.*
3. Separating an 'introductory thought'.
*In fact, one of the rules enacted by the English court system in the
17th century is still relevant in the United States in the 21st century.*
4. Separating out a 'descriptive phrase'.  A pair of commas surrounds a phrase
giving more information about something.  
*Delta group, who made the biggest improvement on the first practice test, will
never become complacent.*


### Colon Usage

There are two places where one uses a colon:

1. Starting off a list.

*New York City has five boroughs: Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, the Bronx, and
Staten Island.*

2. Joining a phrase with details about the phrase, in a way that emphasizes the
details.

*I was enchanted by the tiniest thing of all: the dachshund puppy.* 

### Semi-colon Usage
