# Punctuation

The writing section tests the follow punctuation: commas `,`, colons `:`, contractions `'`, possession `'`, and dashes `-`.

### Comma Usage

There are four places where one uses a comma:

1. Separating items in a list.
	
	Teachers commonly work many more hours than the official time they spend in school, typically preparing for class, grading exams, and performing other tasks outside the formally defined school day.


2. Before a conjunction (F.A.N.B.O.Y: for, and, nor, but, or, yet) joining two sentences.


	I am tired, but I will keep studying for the SAT.


3. Separating an 'introductory thought'.

	In fact, one of the rules enacted by the English court system in the 17th century is still relevant in the United States in the 21st century.

4. Separating out a 'descriptive phrase'.  A pair of commas surrounds a phrase giving more information about something.  

	Delta group, which made the biggest improvement on the first practice test, will never become complacent.
